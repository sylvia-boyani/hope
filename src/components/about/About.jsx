          <h3>Vision</h3>
          <p>To rehabilitate slum dwellers and train them and 
             other young people for Christian living and ministry
            through our one year Discipleship program. Offering
            additional assistance in their spiritual or secular development
            for those who left the program. 
            To have a life changing 
            impact to slum dwellers through teams of young people who
            evangelize and plant independent churches in the slums of
             nairobi.
            To establish social ministries which will meet the needs of slum 
            dwellers as an act of Christian compassion and as a means to
            reach them with the gospel.</p>
            <h3>Mission</h3>
            <p>To establish leader-ships and fellowships of 
               Christian believers, healthy and stable spiritually, 
              socially, physically and psychologically in the slums
              and other areas of need.</p>
